# Classifying Disaster Tweets with Natural Language Processing
Today, social networks play a huge role in the lives of most people in the world. An example of such a network could be Twitter. Users are tweeting on a wide range of topics every day from Politics to sports or even human-made or natural disasters.
<br /><br /> However, it is not always straightforward to distinguish between a genuine and a fake disaster tweet.
<br /><br /> Thus, in this work, three classification models are proposed which can identify and distinguish the tweets attributed to disasters, including the **LSTM** model, **SVC** and **Random Forest**. The evaluation results show that the SVC model has the major improvement in classification performance, which achieves the accuracy of **80.69**.
<br /><br /> The full report paper of this work named as **Disaster Tweets Report**, the codes and csv dataset files can be found in this repository.
